A landing page

Title
Car Landing Page

I started this project to get more grounds on my HTML and CSS skills.

The project has a good scroling effect and the use of good css and bootstrap skills.

The site can be copied from github and be edited on vscode

I used bootstrap cdn links to get the bootstrap design.
